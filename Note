------Bit Manipulation------ 

Shift bit pattern left by 1:-->  Multiply by 2
Shift bit pattern right by 1:--> Divide by 2

(1<<31)>>1= -2^31/2
To preserve the sign of a signed int MSB bit(bit 1), will get replicated.


Airthmatic rightshift vs logical right shift. 
In Airthmatic left shift MSB or signed bit gets copied to preserve the sign ,specical behaviour signed int.
Logical right shit where MSB is not preserve. it moved and zero gets padded


-----Bit Masking------
Set:- OR with 1 
Clear Bit :-- AND with 0
Target the bits with shift operations.
